# UI_Challenge
## Introduction

- I found this challenge on Internet while I was learning Android Studio in Java. It is a registration form which will check if all the informations is valid or not before pop up a snackbar that tells user the registarion is success.

## Descripton

Quite simple. you enter your information like name, email, etc...

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
